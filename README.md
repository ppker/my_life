thooooopppppp pppppp my lift record and correcting shortcomings 

When politics professors like myself tell the story of the internet, there are a few touchstone events. The biggest pppppp the Battle of Seattle, the vibrant, vocal antiglobalization protest convened at the cityâ€™s convention center in 1999. It was a bit of a shock, reading through the WIRED archive, to realize that the magazine never mentioned these massive protests.


WIRED, like most of the tech industry, had a selective view of politics: Economic globalization and digital networking were interlocking forces for good. It reveled in the potential of both, and shrugged off the critics.
